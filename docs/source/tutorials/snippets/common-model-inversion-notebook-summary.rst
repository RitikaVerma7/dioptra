From here, you will follow the provided instructions to run the demo provided in the Jupyter notebook.
Running the first 3 blocks will set up the the environment.
Running block 5 will generate a new ``shallow_net`` model for classifying MNIST images.

Once the models are initialized and the environment is configured, you will be able to run the rest of the demo.
Running block 7 will run the model inversion attack on the MNIST shallow_net model.
