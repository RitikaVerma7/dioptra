Once the startup process completes, open up your web browser and enter http://localhost:38888 in the address bar to access the Jupyter Lab interface (if nothing shows up, wait 10-15 more seconds and try again).
Double click the ``work`` folder and open the ``demo_production.ipynb`` file.
Before doing anything else, take the time to set your user id in the first code block.

.. note::

   The user id can be anything you'd like it to be, but be aware that it will be publicly viewable to all users with access to the Testbed's MLFlow dashboard.
